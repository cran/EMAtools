Description: Do data management functions common in real-time monitoring (also called: ecological momentary assessment, experience sampling, micro-longitudinal) data, including centering on participant means and merging event-level data into momentary data sets where you need
    the events to correspond to the nearest data point in the momentary data. This is VERY early release software, and more features will be added over time.
